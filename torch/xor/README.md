<h1>XOR classifier</h1>

To launch the code download the <strong>xor</strong> folder and run the file xor.lua .

Inside that file, you can edit several parameters:
	<ul>
	<li> architecture of the network </li>
	<li> add weight decay </li>
	<li> learning rate </li>
	</ul>

As default options it is created a network with 2 hidden layers, 
the weight decay is off, and at runtime 3 plots are saved in the current directory.
